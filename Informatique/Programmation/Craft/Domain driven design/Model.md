Valuable model requires a deep understanding of the domain. This understanding comes from diving in and implementaing an initial design based on a naive model and transforming it again and again through the [[Knowledge crunching]] process.
The model


Each time the teams gains insigth, the model is transformed to reveal that richer knwoledge.
A model is a simplification, an interpretation of reality to a particular purpose

A domain model 
- is a rigorously organized and selective abstraction of the knowledge
- forces the developers to learn the important principles of the business
- is the core of a common language, the semantic of the [[Communication]]
- 

Basics use of a model :
- *The model and the heart of design shape each other* 
- *The model is the backbone of a language used by all team members*
- *The model is a distilled knowledge*


Play with the model as you talk about thre system. Describe scenarios out loud using the elements and interactions of the model, combining concepts in ways allowed by the model. Find easier ways to say what you need to say, and then take those new ideas back down to the diagram and code.
