Premise of DDD is twofold:
- the primary focsu should be on the domain and the domain logic
- Complex domain design should be based on a [[model]]

DDD isn't a methodology but a new family of "Agile development process". 
Two practices are prerequisites for applying this approach :
- Development is iterative
- Developers and domain experts have a close relationship 

Extreme programming is the most prominent of the agile processes. 
- It emphasize the ability to cope with change and uncertainty. 
- It puts effort on communication and imporving the project
=> Use the simpliest thing that could work and then, continuous refactor (smal design improvement)
