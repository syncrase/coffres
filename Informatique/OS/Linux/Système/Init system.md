The init system is the first process started on a Linux platform after the kernel starts, and manages all other processes on the system. The init system uses an [[Init script]] to start, restart, or stop a [[daemon]] process. Recent versions of Linux tend to use the [[systemd]] init system, which uses the [[systemctl]] command, while older versions tend to use the **System V** init system, which uses the service command.
